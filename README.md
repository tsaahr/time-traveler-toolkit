Time Travel Simulator â€“ Python Project
This is a Python project built during my learning process.
It simulates a fictional time travel booking system that generates a travel destination, year, and cost dynamically.

What does the program do?
Gets the current date and time and formats it.

Randomly selects a year between 1500 and 3000 as the target travel year.

Picks a destination from a predefined list.

Calculates the cost of the trip based on the distance in years from the present.

Formats the final cost using the Decimal module to ensure precision.

Uses a custom module to generate a formatted travel message.

Technologies used
Python 3

datetime module for current time

decimal.Decimal for accurate currency calculation

random module (randint, choice) for randomness

Custom module (custom_module.py) with external function

String formatting with f-strings

Status
