# Time Travel Quote Generator â€“ Python Project

This is a Python project built during my learning process.  
It simulates a fictional time travel agency by generating a travel quote based on year, destination, and cost.

## What does the program do?

* Gets the current date and time  
* Randomly selects a target year between 1500 and 3000  
* Chooses a fictional destination from a preset list  
* Calculates the price based on year difference and cost multiplier  
* Formats the total cost using `Decimal` for precision  
* Generates and prints a formatted message using a custom module

## Technologies used

* Python 3  
* Built-in modules: `datetime`, `random`, `decimal`  
* External custom module with reusable functions  
* String formatting with `f-strings`  
* Random selection with `randint` and `choice`  
* Date and time formatting  
* Arithmetic operations and type casting
